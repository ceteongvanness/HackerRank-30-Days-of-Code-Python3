**Day 4: Class vs. Instance**

**Task**

Write a Person class with an instance variable, *age*, and a constructor that takes an integer, *initialAge*, as a parameter. The constructor must assign *initialAge* to *age* after confirming the argument passed as *initialAge* is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as *initialAge*, the constructor should set *age* to *0* and print `Age is not valid, setting age to 0.`. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

1. yearPasses() should increase the *age* instance variable by *1*.
2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
   - If *age < 13*, print `You are young.`.
   - If *age >= 13* and *age < 18*, print `You are teenager.`.
   - Otherwise, print `You are old.`.

**Input Format**

Input is handled for you by the stub code in the editor.

The first line contains an integer, *T* (the number of test cases), and the *T* subsequent lines each contain an integer denoting the *age* of a Person instance.

**Constraints**

- 1 <= T <= 4
- -5 <= age <= 30

**Output Format**

Complete the method definitions provided in the editor so they meet the specifications outlined above; the code to test your work is already in the editor. If your methods are implemented correctly, each test case 
will print *2* or *3*  lines (depending on whether or not a valid *initialAge* was passed to the constructor).
